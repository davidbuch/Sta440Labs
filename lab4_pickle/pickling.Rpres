Pickling Data
========================================================
Pickle files are data that have been serialized using Python's specific serialization protocol. To translate an object into pickle format, we open a file connection (to **write bytestreams**), `dump` in a variable, and close the file connection.

```{r, eval = F}
import pickle

structured_data = {"Name" : "Simon Rich", "Occupation": "Pickler"}
pickle_barrel = open("simon.pickle", "wb")
pickle.dump(structured_data, pickle_barrel)
pickle_barrel.close()
```

Unpickling Data
========================================================
To unpickle data, we follow the pickling workflow in reverse: open the file connection (to **read** bytestreams), `load` it into a variable, and then close the connection.
```{r, eval = F}
import pickle

pickle_barrel = open("simon.pickle", "rb")
structured_simon = pickle.load(pickle_barrel)
pickle_barrel.close()
print(structured_simon)
```

Working on the DCC
========================================================

* Recall that to take advantage of DCC computing resources we must submit jobs to the SLURM workload manager.

* The jobs are formulated as a series of Bash terminal commands, along with Slurm options specified through a special comment syntax, collected into a `.sh` file. 

Using Pickle Data on the DCC
======================
Since pickling is a Python serialization tool, but we want to write our analyses in R, a basic exploratoration of the pickled WESAD data will require 3 components

1. Bash (`.sh`) file, with Slurm options, that calls Python and R scripts
2. Python unpickling script
3. R analysis script

Bash File (with Slurm options)
===========================
```{r, eval = F}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=sta440-f20
#SBATCH -p common
#SBATCH --mem=2G

module load R
module load Python
python unpickle.py
Rscript summary_stats.R
```
